# Advent-of-code
## My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles using C++

## Running the solution
- To compile and run the solution, move to `<year>/<day>`.
- Run the solution using g++ like so:

```bash
cd 2022/day1
```
```bash
g++ --std=c++17 solution.cpp
./a.out
```

If `g++` is old or you see errors while compiling, update `g++` on Ubuntu using:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc g++
```

Note: 
- Do not forget to modify my input to your input to check your solution
