## My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles using C++

## Running the solution
- To compile and run the solution, go into `<year>/<day>` directory.

  Example:
  `cd 2022/day1`
- Compile the solution using `g++`:
  ```bash
  g++ --std=c++14 solution.cpp
  ```
- Run the solution (Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  ./a.out
  ```

```bash
cd 2022/day1
g++ --std=c++14 solution.cpp
./a.out
```

### Using Ubuntu
If `g++` is not present, install using:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc g++
```

### Using Windows
If `g++` is not present, refer [Setting up GCC on windows](./GCC%20on%20Windows/README.md).
